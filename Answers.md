1.  Explain the differences between `client-side  routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-Side routing is the old way of requesting information from a server. When a user clicks on something, the server sends back what was requested, and our URL changes to match. This is all handled by the server, which makes web pages take awhile to load between simple clicks, especially if bandwidth is an issue. Client side routing is using javascript to maintain the memory within our applications and the browser, telling the browser what to display. The page will not refresh between clicks on the page.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. The post method is mapped to create, which creates data for our app. Read is the get method, which we use to get data from a server or API. Update is for the Put method, which we use to update the data we have. And lastly Delete is for delete, which, well, deletes.

AJAX has a number of tools available, including all the previously mentioned methods: Post, Get, Put, and Delete. We can also use methods like .then() or .catch(), which are callback functions that give us responses from servers.
